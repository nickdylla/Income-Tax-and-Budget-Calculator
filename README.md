# Income-Tax-and-Budget-Calculator
A breakdown of income tax (federal and state) for both flat rate and bracketed state taxes. Also includes a budget function for living expenses. Useful for estimating how much the user will make per year after accounting for taxes, social security, and medicare. This also provides a budgeting function that allows the user to input their living expenses to subtract from their estimated salary-post taxes etc..

## Getting Started
No packages necessary

## What does it do?
`fed_tax_func` calculates federal taxes using the bracketed approach

`il_budget` calculates the amount of taxes (flat rate state tax, e.g. Illinois), social security, and medicare removed from salary

`mo_tax_func`calculates the state taxes (Missouri) using the bracketed approach

`mo_budget` calculates the amount of taxes (bracketed state tax, e.g. Missouri), social security, and medicare removed from salary

`custom_living_expenses_func` calculates the cost of living expenses and subtracts them from the user's salary. The user can pass his/her salar,post-taxes, to get the most accurate estimation of costs. 

## Motivation
This is just a personal tool that I used for myself but figured others might find it useful.
